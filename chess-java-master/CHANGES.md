# Changes Made to the Java Chess Project

## Code Refactoring

### Board.java Improvements
1. **Resource String Management**
   - Created a structured naming pattern with prefix and suffix constants
   - Added a `getResourceFilename()` helper method for consistent filename generation
   - Reduced 12 separate constants to a more maintainable system

2. **Board Constants**
   - Added `BOARD_SIZE` and related dimension constants
   - Replaced magic numbers with named constants
   - Improved code readability and maintainability

3. **Methods Restructuring**
   - Created `setDimensions()` to eliminate repetitive dimension setting
   - Added `initializeSquares()` for clearer board setup
   - Broke down `initializePieces()` into smaller specialized methods
   - Added `isCorrectTurn()` and `handleCheckmate()` helpers to reduce duplicated logic

4. **Mouse Handling**
   - Added `getSquareAtPosition()` for square lookup
   - Created position updating helper methods
   - Improved event handling organization

### Piece.java Improvements
1. **Movement Logic**
   - Added direction constants (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
   - Created `findOccupationLimit()` method to handle all directional checks
   - Eliminated duplicated movement code

2. **Diagonal Movement**
   - Added `collectDiagonalSquares()` helper method
   - Reduced four almost identical code blocks to one reusable method
   - Improved maintainability and readability

## Unit Testing

Created a comprehensive testing suite with separate test classes for each component:

1. **Base Test Infrastructure**
   - `ChessTestBase.java` providing common testing utilities:
     - Board initialization
     - Piece placement
     - Move verification

2. **Piece-Specific Tests**
   - Individual test classes for each piece type:
     - `PawnTest.java`
     - `RookTest.java`
     - `KnightTest.java`
     - `BishopTest.java`
     - `QueenTest.java`
     - `KingTest.java`

3. **Game Mechanics Tests**
   - `CheckmateTest.java` for complex chess rules:
     - Check detection
     - Checkmate verification
     - Blocking checks
     - Capturing attacking pieces
     - Stalemate conditions

Each test class contains multiple test methods verifying specific aspects of chess movement and rules, including:
- Basic movement patterns
- Capture mechanics
- Piece interactions (blocking, jumping)
- Check and checkmate detection

## Documentation
- Updated README.md with detailed information on:
  - Recent improvements
  - Code organization
  - Testing structure
  - How to run tests
- Added this CHANGES.md file to document refactoring details

## Overall Benefits
- **Improved Code Quality**: Eliminated duplication, increased modularity
- **Better Maintainability**: Added constants, helper methods, and clear organization
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Added comprehensive unit tests
- **Better Documentation**: Updated README and added CHANGES document
